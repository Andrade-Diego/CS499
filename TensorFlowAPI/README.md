# TensorFlow API- Detecting Parking Lot Spaces Occupied/Empty

Since the tensorflow API is too large to properly push to this directory, I have forked my modifications to the repository shown below.
* [Tensorflow Object Detection API(v1.13.0)](https://github.com/apschuster/models/tree/r1.13.0) - Object Detection API


## Getting Started

Loose Instructions: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-training-image-classifier-using-tensorflow-object-detection-api/
* These are loose instructions that my own instructions will be slightly based on. Please only refer to these if my instructions are unclear at any point

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software

```
Pip version 19.0.0 or newer
Python 3.x (3.7.4 in my case)
A clone of my modification of the object detection API at: Tensorflow Object Detection API(v1.13.0)(https://github.com/apschuster/models/tree/r1.13.0)
pip install tensorflow==1.15.0
pip install protobuf
pip install pillow
pip install lxml
pip install Cython
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install opencv-python 

```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

If not already installed, install python 3 (3.7.4) and pip (19.0.0 or newer) on your system, links/instructions are provided below.
```
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-374/
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo


## Deployment

Will add when relevant.
