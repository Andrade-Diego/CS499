# TensorFlow API
Since the tensorflow API is too large to properly push to this directory, I have forked my modifications to the repository shown below labeled besides "Reference", all instructions going forward should clone that repository.

Loose Instructions: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-training-image-classifier-using-tensorflow-object-detection-api/
    - These are loose instructions that my own instructions will be slightly based on. Please only refer to these if my instructions are unclear at any point
